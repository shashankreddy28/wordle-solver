## Technical Overview

- **popup.html / popup.js**: The user interface and logic for input and displaying suggestions.
- **background.js**: Manages communication between the popup and content scripts, and programmatically injects the content script.
- **content.js**: Injected into the Wordle game page, it robustly extracts game data (guesses and feedback) from both NYT Wordle and Wordle Archive, handling complex page structures including Shadow DOM.
- **solver.js**: Implements the filtering algorithm to suggest valid words.
- **wordlist.js**: Contains the list of valid 5-letter words.
- **manifest.json**: Chrome extension manifest (permissions, scripts, etc).
- **styles.css**: Styles for the popup UI.
- **icon.png**: Extension icon.

### How it Works

1. **Game Data Extraction**: When you click "Import All Attempts", the `background.js` script injects `content.js` into the active Wordle tab. `content.js` then performs a deep search for the game board, extracts all previous guesses and their feedback, and sends this data back to the `popup.js`.
2. **User Input**: You can also manually enter your guess and feedback.
3. **Word Filtering**: The `solver.js` filters the word list based on your input and the imported attempts.
4. **Suggestions Display**: The `popup.js` displays the top suggestions.
